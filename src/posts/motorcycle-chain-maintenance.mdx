Your motorcycle's chain is its final drive, transferring all the engine's power to the rear wheel. Neglecting it is a recipe for poor performance, premature wear, and even danger. Proper chain maintenance is a quick and easy job that every rider should know.

## Clean, Lube, and Adjust

Chain maintenance comes down to three simple steps, ideally performed every 500 miles or so.

### 1. Cleaning

A dirty chain wears out faster. Use a dedicated chain cleaning fluid and a three-sided grunge brush. Put the bike on a rear stand, spray the cleaner onto the chain while rotating the rear wheel, and scrub all four sides. Wipe it dry with a rag.

### 2. Lubricating

Lubrication is best done when the chain is warm after a ride. Use a quality chain lube, not WD-40. As you rotate the rear wheel, spray the lube onto the inside of the chain, aiming for the O-rings or X-rings on the side plates. A little goes a long way; excess lube just flings off and makes a mess. Let it sit for a while to allow the carrier solvents to evaporate.

### 3. Adjusting

Your chain needs a specific amount of slack to account for suspension movement. Too tight, and it will strain your drivetrain. Too loose, and it could skip or come off. Check your owner's manual for the correct slack measurement (usually 1-1.5 inches).

To adjust, loosen the rear axle nut. Use the adjuster bolts on the swingarm to move the wheel back, making small, equal turns on each side. Check the alignment marks to ensure the wheel is straight. Once the slack is correct, tighten the axle nut to the specified torque.
