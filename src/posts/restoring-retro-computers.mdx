In a world of disposable technology, there's a growing movement to preserve and restore the computers of our youth. The hobby of retro-computing is part history, part engineering, and all nostalgia.

## The First Hurdle: Powering On

Before you even think of plugging in that 30-year-old computer, STOP. The most common point of failure in old electronics are the electrolytic capacitors. Over time, they dry out, leak, and fail, often taking other components with them.

"Recapping"—the process of replacing all the electrolytic capacitors on a motherboard and power supply—is the most important first step. It's a soldering-intensive job, but it's crucial for the long-term health of your machine.

## Common Restoration Tasks

- **Retr0brighting:** Old ABS plastic often turns a sickly yellow due to UV exposure. Retr0brighting is the process of using a hydrogen peroxide solution and UV light to reverse this chemical reaction and restore the original color.
- **Drive Repairs:** Floppy drives and old hard drives often suffer from dried-out grease and failing rubber belts. Disassembly, cleaning, and re-lubrication can often bring them back to life.
- **Battery Replacement:** Many old computers used a battery to maintain settings, and these are almost always dead and often leaking acid that destroys the motherboard. Removing and neutralizing the leakage is a top priority.

Restoring a vintage computer like a Commodore 64, an Apple II, or an old 486 PC is a journey back in time. The satisfaction of hearing that boot-up chime and seeing that command prompt is a unique and wonderful feeling.
