When you want to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine, you need a Type-1 hypervisor. For homelabbers, the choice usually boils down to two excellent options: Proxmox VE and VMware ESXi.

## Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE)

Proxmox is a completely free and open-source platform based on Debian Linux. It's beloved in the homelab community for its powerful features and lack of licensing restrictions.

- **Pros:** No cost, feature-rich web interface, supports both KVM-based VMs and LXC containers, built-in backup and clustering features, ZFS support out-of-the-box.
- **Cons:** Can have a steeper learning curve for beginners, community support model (paid support is optional).

## VMware ESXi

ESXi is the industry standard in enterprise virtualization. While many of its advanced features require expensive licenses, VMware offers a free tier that is more than adequate for most homelabs.

- **Pros:** Extremely stable and reliable, polished and mature interface, huge amount of enterprise documentation and knowledge available, broad hardware compatibility.
- **Cons:** The free license has limitations (e.g., max 8 vCPUs per VM), advanced features are locked behind a paywall, no easy built-in container solution like Proxmox.

## Which One is for You?

If you want a completely free, unrestricted, and highly customizable platform and are willing to learn, **Proxmox** is an unbeatable choice. It's the quintessential homelabber's tool.

If you are looking to learn skills for a career in IT, or if you prefer a more "it just works" experience and can live with the free-tier limitations, **ESXi** is a fantastic and professional-grade option.
