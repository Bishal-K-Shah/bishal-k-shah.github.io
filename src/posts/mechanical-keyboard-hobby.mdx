What if the keyboard you type on every day could be a personalized work of art, perfectly tuned to your preferences? Welcome to the obsessive, wonderful world of custom mechanical keyboards.

## More Than Just a Keyboard

Unlike the mushy membrane keyboards most people are used to, mechanical keyboards use individual physical switches under each key. This provides superior tactile and auditory feedback, durability, and an endless potential for customization.

## The Holy Trinity: Switches, Keycaps, and Case

- **Switches:** The heart of the keyboard. They determine the feel and sound. They come in three main types: **Linear** (smooth), **Tactile** (with a bump), and **Clicky** (with a bump and an audible click). Popular brands include Cherry, Gateron, and Kailh.
- **Keycaps:** The plastic caps you press. They come in various profiles (shapes), materials (ABS or PBT plastic), and countless colorways. This is where you can truly express your personality.
- **Case & Plate:** The enclosure for the keyboard. Materials like aluminum, polycarbonate, and acrylic all affect the sound and feel of the keyboard, a concept known as "sound signature".

## Getting Started

The easiest way to start is with a "hot-swappable" keyboard. These boards have sockets that allow you to change switches easily without any soldering. A great entry-level hot-swap board is the Keychron V-series or the Glorious GMMK Pro.

From there, you can experiment with different switches, try out new keycaps, and even perform mods like lubricating switches or adding foam to the case to change the sound. It's a deep and rewarding hobby that makes the everyday act of typing a joy.
