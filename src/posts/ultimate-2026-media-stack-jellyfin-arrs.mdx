## Installing Jellyfin

### Docker Installation (Recommended)

The easiest way to run Jellyfin is with Docker. Here's a complete `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  jellyfin:
    image: jellyfin/jellyfin:latest
    container_name: jellyfin
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8096:8096"
      - "8920:8920"  # HTTPS
    volumes:
      - ./jellyfin/config:/config
      - ./jellyfin/cache:/cache
      - /path/to/your/media:/data/media:ro
      - /path/to/your/movies:/data/movies:ro
      - /path/to/your/tv:/data/tv:ro
    environment:
      - JELLYFIN_PublishedServerUrl=http://your-domain.com
    devices:
      - /dev/dri:/dev/dri  # For hardware transcoding (Intel/AMD)
    networks:
      - media-network

networks:
  media-network:
    driver: bridge
```

Start Jellyfin:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Access Jellyfin at `http://localhost:8096` and complete the initial setup wizard.

### Native Installation

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**

```bash
# Add Jellyfin repository
sudo apt install apt-transport-https
wget -O - https://repo.jellyfin.org/jellyfin_team.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb [arch=$( dpkg --print-architecture )] https://repo.jellyfin.org/$( awk -F'=' '/^ID=/{ print $NF }' /etc/os-release ) $( awk -F'=' '/^VERSION_CODENAME=/{ print $NF }' /etc/os-release ) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jellyfin.list

# Install Jellyfin
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jellyfin
```

**Windows/macOS:**
Download the installer from [jellyfin.org](https://jellyfin.org/downloads)

## Hardware Transcoding Setup

One of Jellyfin's strongest features is excellent hardware transcoding support. This is crucial for serving multiple clients simultaneously.

### Intel Quick Sync

For Intel processors with integrated graphics:

```yaml
# In docker-compose.yml
devices:
  - /dev/dri:/dev/dri
```

In Jellyfin settings:
1. Dashboard → Playback → Transcoding
2. Enable "Hardware acceleration"
3. Select "Video Acceleration API (VAAPI)" or "Intel QuickSync"

### NVIDIA GPU

For NVIDIA GPUs:

```yaml
# In docker-compose.yml
runtime: nvidia
environment:
  - NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all
```

Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

In Jellyfin, select "NVIDIA NVENC" for hardware acceleration.

### Testing Transcoding

To verify transcoding works:
1. Play a video in a format your client doesn't support natively
2. Check Jellyfin dashboard → Playback → Active Encodings
3. Verify hardware acceleration is being used

## Migrating Your Library

### Step 1: Export Plex Metadata (Optional)

While you can't directly import Plex data into Jellyfin, you can:

1. Use tools like `plex-export` to export your library structure
2. Document custom collections and playlists manually
3. Note any special metadata you've added

### Step 2: Point Jellyfin to Your Media

1. In Jellyfin Dashboard → Libraries
2. Add Library → Choose content type (Movies, TV Shows, etc.)
3. Add folder path (your existing media location)
4. Configure metadata settings
5. Let Jellyfin scan and organize

### Step 3: Reorganize Media (If Needed)

Jellyfin works best with organized folder structures:

```
/movies
  /Movie Name (Year)
    Movie Name (Year).mkv
    Movie Name (Year).en.srt

/tv
  /Show Name
    /Season 01
      Show Name - S01E01 - Episode Title.mkv
```

Tools like `filebot` or `tidy` can help reorganize existing media.

### Step 4: Import Metadata

Jellyfin will automatically:
- Fetch metadata from TheMovieDB, TheTVDB, etc.
- Download artwork and posters
- Organize episodes and seasons
- Match files to database entries

You can manually refresh metadata for specific items if needed.

## Advanced Jellyfin Configuration

### User Management

Create user accounts with appropriate permissions:

1. Dashboard → Users → Add User
2. Set username, password, and display name
3. Configure access to specific libraries
4. Set playback restrictions (max bitrate, etc.)

### Plugins

Jellyfin has a growing plugin ecosystem:

- **Trakt**: Sync watch history with Trakt.tv
- **LDAP Authentication**: Integrate with LDAP/Active Directory
- **MusicBrainz**: Enhanced music metadata
- **Auto Organize**: Automatically organize new media

Install plugins from Dashboard → Plugins.

### Custom Branding

Customize Jellyfin's appearance:

1. Dashboard → Display → Custom CSS
2. Add custom CSS for branding
3. Upload custom logos and splash screens

## Remote Access Setup

### Reverse Proxy with Nginx

For secure remote access, use a reverse proxy:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name jellyfin.yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8096;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

### Using Traefik

If you're already using Traefik:

```yaml
services:
  jellyfin:
    # ... existing config
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.jellyfin.rule=Host(`jellyfin.yourdomain.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.jellyfin.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.jellyfin.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt"
```

## Automation Workflow

Once everything is configured, your media stack works automatically:

1. **Add Content**: Search for a movie/show in Radarr/Sonarr
2. **Monitor**: The Arr apps monitor for releases
3. **Download**: When available, content is automatically downloaded
4. **Organize**: Files are moved to proper locations and renamed
5. **Notify**: Jellyfin is notified and scans for new content
6. **Available**: Content appears in Jellyfin library automatically

## Performance Optimization

### Transcoding Settings

Optimize transcoding for your use case:

- **Hardware Acceleration**: Always enable if available
- **Transcoding Quality**: Balance quality vs. performance
- **Concurrent Streams**: Monitor server resources

### Storage Optimization

- Use SSD for Jellyfin cache and metadata
- Organize media on HDDs for cost-effective storage
- Consider network storage (NFS/SMB) for large libraries

### Network Optimization

- Use wired connections for servers
- Configure proper network segmentation
- Consider dedicated VLAN for media traffic

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Transcoding Failures

- Verify hardware acceleration is working
- Check GPU drivers are up to date
- Review Jellyfin logs for specific errors
- Test with software transcoding as fallback

### Library Not Updating

- Manually trigger library scan
- Check file permissions
- Verify media paths are correct
- Review Jellyfin logs

### Arr Apps Not Communicating

- Verify all services are on the same Docker network
- Check API keys are correct
- Ensure ports are properly exposed
- Review connection settings in each app
