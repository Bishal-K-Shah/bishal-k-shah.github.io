**1. Immediate Fix - Jump Start:**
```bash
# If 12V battery is dead:
1. Use jump starter or another vehicle
2. Connect to 12V battery terminals (under hood or in trunk)
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for systems to initialize
4. Start vehicle normally
5. Drive for 30+ minutes to recharge 12V battery
```

**2. Check 12V Battery Health:**
- Test voltage with multimeter (should be 12.6V+ when charged)
- Load test battery at auto parts store
- Replace if voltage drops below 12V or fails load test

**3. Preventative Maintenance:**
- Drive vehicle regularly (at least once per week)
- Ensure vehicle enters sleep mode (check for lights/electronics off)
- Consider battery tender if vehicle sits for extended periods
- Update software (newer versions improve battery management)

**4. Software Fix:**
