excerpt: 'Discover how Intel N100 mini PCs can replace power-hungry servers, running your entire homelab on just 15W while delivering impressive performance for self-hosted services.'
---

Running a 24/7 homelab server used to mean accepting high electricity bills. A typical desktop PC running as a server can consume 100-200W continuously, costing hundreds of dollars per year in electricity. But what if you could run your entire homelab stack—Docker containers, virtual machines, media servers, and more—on just 15 watts?

Enter the **Intel N100** processor. This low-power chip has revolutionized the mini PC market, offering desktop-class performance at a fraction of the power consumption. Combined with modern mini PC designs, you can build a silent, efficient homelab that costs less than $50 per year to run.

## The Power Consumption Problem

### Traditional Server Costs

A typical homelab setup might include:
- **Desktop PC Server**: 100-150W idle, 200W+ under load
- **Annual Cost** (at $0.12/kWh): $105-$157 idle, $210+ under load
- **24/7 Operation**: Adds up quickly over years

### The Mini PC Solution

Modern mini PCs with efficient processors like the N100:
- **Idle Power**: 8-12W
- **Load Power**: 15-20W
- **Annual Cost**: $8-$21 (at $0.12/kWh)
- **Savings**: $100-150+ per year compared to traditional servers

Over 5 years, that's $500-750 in electricity savings—often more than the cost of the hardware itself.
