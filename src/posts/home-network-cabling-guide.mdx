Wi-Fi is convenient, but for any serious homelab user, gamer, or media streamer, a wired network is non-negotiable. While running cables through your walls seems like a professional's job, it's a very manageable DIY project with the right tools and planning.

## Planning Your Runs

Before you drill a single hole, plan everything. Decide where you want your network drops. A central location, like a closet or basement, is the perfect spot for your "network hub" where your modem, router, and switch will live. This is where all your cable runs will terminate.

## Tools & Materials

- **Bulk Ethernet Cable:** Cat6 or Cat6a is the standard. Solid copper is a must for in-wall runs. Avoid "CCA" (Copper Clad Aluminum).
- **Keystone Jacks and Wall Plates:** These provide a clean, professional finish for your network drops.
- **Patch Panel:** This is where you'll terminate the cables at your network hub. It keeps everything organized.
- **Punch-Down Tool:** For connecting the wires to keystone jacks and the patch panel.
- **Fish Tape or Glow Rods:** Essential for pulling cables through walls and ceilings.

## The Process

1.  **Hub Setup:** Mount your patch panel in your chosen hub location.
2.  **Cutting Holes:** At each drop location, use a low-voltage mounting bracket as a template to cut a hole in the drywall.
3.  **Running the Cable:** This is the hardest part. Use fish tape to pull cables from the hub to each drop location. Go through the basement or attic whenever possible. Avoid running parallel to electrical wires to prevent interference.
4.  **Termination:** At the wall plate, strip the cable jacket, untwist the pairs, and use the punch-down tool to connect the wires to the keystone jack (follow the T568B color code). Do the same at the patch panel.
5.  **Testing:** Use a simple Ethernet cable tester to confirm all your connections are good before you plug in your expensive equipment.

Running your own cable is a game-changer, providing rock-solid connectivity for your entire home.
