Painting is the most cost-effective way to completely change the look and feel of a room. While it seems simple—dip roller, apply to wall—achieving a professional finish requires technique and the right preparation.

## Preparation is 80% of the Work

If you start painting immediately, you've already failed. The difference between a landlord special and a pro job is prep.

1.  **Clean the Walls:** Dust and grease prevent paint adhesion. Wash your walls with TSP (Trisodium Phosphate) or a mild detergent.
2.  **Patch and Sand:** Fill nail holes with spackle. Once dry, sand them flush. Then, give the *entire wall* a light sanding with 120-grit paper to give the paint some "tooth" to grab onto.
3.  **Tape Correctly:** Use high-quality painter's tape (like FrogTape). Press the edges down firmly with a putty knife to prevent bleed-through.

## The "W" Technique

Don't just roll up and down randomly. To ensure even coverage:

1.  Load your roller evenly. It should be saturated but not dripping.
2.  Start in a corner and roll a large "W" shape on the wall (about 3x3 feet).
3.  Without reloading, fill in the "W" with vertical strokes.
4.  Finish with a light "backroll"—a single, smooth stroke from ceiling to floor to level the texture.

## Cutting In

"Cutting in" refers to painting the edges and corners where a roller can't reach.

*   **Do this first:** Always cut in before you roll. This allows the roller to cover the brush marks for a seamless texture.
*   **Use an angled brush:** A 2.5-inch angled sash brush is your best friend for clean lines against ceilings and trim.

With patience and the right technique, you can achieve a finish that looks like you hired a pro crew.
