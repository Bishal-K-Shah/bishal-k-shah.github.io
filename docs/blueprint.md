# **App Name**: Hobbyist's Hideaway

## Core Features:

- Blog Post Creation: Enable the creation of blog posts using MDX or similar format, with support for embedding images and code snippets directly within the content. Offer simple formatting options and previews to ensure visual appeal. Store as static files within the repository.
- Category Management: Implement a system to categorize blog posts into predefined categories (Automobile, Technology, Electronics, HomeLab). Each post should belong to at least one category to enable filtering and organization.
- Homepage Layout: Design a visually appealing homepage that dynamically displays a mix of blog posts from various categories. Use a card-based layout or similar, with engaging featured images and brief excerpts. Include a filter bar to quickly narrow the selection to posts from one specific category.
- Blog Post Examples: Include some sample blog posts, formatted and complete with featured images, as an example. Examples could include 'The revival of classic car', 'How to setup raspberry pi-based home server', 'A comprehensive guide to 3d printer kit for beginers'.
